Learned how to create a new branch

Su's Reflection

Today I learned how to clone a repo, ignore the changes and create a branch in GitHub.

The steps have been really clear, for something that could potentially quite confusing.

I have learnt how to structure branches and the concept map of Git, understanding how all the elements piece together. 

Learning about GitHub is great!
